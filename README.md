# etsysearch
*A small tool that searches Etsy*

This is a small tool that searches the Etsy catalogue, with an alternative (horizontal) presentation.

Currently, we're still in an **early version**, so we're limiting results to 100 items.
	
jQuery
------
*Just a spoonful to help the medicine go down*

In the future, we hope to make a completely-vanilla version of this site, but we cannot negate the **obvious utility** that using something like jQuery offers.

Presently, we're only using it for $(document).ready(...), and some function proxying, nothing major. All DOM functions are handled with vanilla JS.
